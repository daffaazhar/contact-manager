# Contact Manager Node.js
This is a command-line contact management system app created using JavaScript. For now, this contact manager can add contacts into JSON files only. I will continue to develop this contact manager until it can perform other tasks, such as deleting contacts, updating contacts, and displaying a list of existing contacts.
